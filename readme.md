Arduino Twinkle Lights
======================

**This project is a work in progress - nothing to see here at this time.**

This project is an Arduino variant of the [Pimoroni Firefly Light](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/firefly-light) project. I thought the project was cool, but they threw an awful lot of hardware into the solution, so I wanted to see if I could build something with less parts and considerably less money.

I've just started the project, that's why the code is skimpy (and really doesn't do anything right now). Check back later when I actually have this thing working.
